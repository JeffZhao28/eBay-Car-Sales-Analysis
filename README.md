# eBay Car Sales Analysis
In this project, I will be using the dataset for used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classified ads section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle, but the version we will be using was altered to resemble more of what a scraped dataset would look like.  The goal is to clean the data and analyze the used car listings to see how brands and mileage play a role in their pricing.
